# Topic Summaries

Summaries of different topics in science, engineering and physics that I have studied. These are mostly for my benefit during revision and as a reference to what I learned.

Note these "summaries" are **NOT** reproductions of the course materials nor are they copied from the corresponding courses. They were entirely written and typeset from scratch. However, the subject material is going to be nonetheless similar to the corresponding courses.

Where I have re-used content I have attributions throughout. All such content is in the public domain; if you spot something that I need permission for (and is yours!) please don't hesitate to email me or (better yet) open an issue!
